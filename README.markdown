# Day 1: Messaging system (kinda like RSS in Reverse)

## What's that?
We're creating a system where users post messages to each other's XML feeds, which can be read as either some raw XML or RSS. We've got a number of uses in mind for this, but we can't let them all out! For now, we're sharing the tiniest working bit of our protocol along with a chat application which is going to use it. The two don't quite play nicely together at the moment - but it's sure progress.
